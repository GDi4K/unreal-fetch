**[Watch the Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPVwaP792MA&feature=youtu.be)**

## Features

With this plugin, you can talk to HTTP APIs very quickly from Blueprints. Here are some core features:

* No C++ or configurations needs when using with Blueprints
* Talk to HTTP Apis with a minimal amount of Blueprint nodes
* Allow to parse & make JSON values via Blueprints
* Works anywhere since this uses internal HTTP & JSON related modules.

## Installation

[**üõç Get the Plugin via the Unreal Marketplace.**](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/fetch-a-simple-http-client)
<br/>

For non-commercial projects, you can also get it from GitHub. Follow these instructions to install:

* Close your existing Unreal Engine app.
* Create a directory in your app root called `Plugins`.
* Download [this](https://github.com/GameDev4K/unreal-fetch/archive/main.zip) GitHub repository.
* Copy `UnrealFetchDevApp/Plugins/Fetch` of the repository to above created `Plugins` directory.
* Start your app & it will ask to compile the plugin. Proceed with that.
* You might need to [setup Visual Studio](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/ProductionPipelines/DevelopmentSetup/VisualStudioSetup/index.html) for Unreal Engine.


## Usage with Blueprints

**[Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPVwaP792MA&feature=youtu.be)** for step by step instructions on how to use this plugin.

Once installed, you can use the `Fetch` static function inside Blueprints to talk to any HTTP API. Here's [an example](https://blueprintue.com/blueprint/kxwkx692/) on invoking a HTTP POST request & extracting the email from the response JSON.

Refer to the following examples for more usage:<br/>
<sup>(You can copy blueprint nodes from the following examples & directly paste them inside your blueprints.)</sup>
